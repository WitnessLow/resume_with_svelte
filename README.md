Two main Svelte updates :
- A toggle button for contacts => enjoy the resume with or without the contacts (see script and style tags at beginning, and starting from line 51)

- A button to keep track of the number of times you read this resume ... Keep clicking for a little surprise ! (see lines 155 - 162)

Enjoy the reactivity :)
